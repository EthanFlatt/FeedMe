# FeedMe

FeedMe is a fullstack MERN application with full CRUD on the back-end and front-end that allows users to enter any amount of ingridients and either get dishes from a database containing those ingridients with instructions on how to make those dishes or use openai's api to get a ChatGPT like response that will teach users what they can make with those ingridients, and how they can make it. There are three schemas in this app, continents, countires, and dishes. Users will be able to search by continent, country, or dish. Users will also be able to use an interactive map where they can click on a country and see the respective dishes associated with it. Users will be able to log in, add dishes to their favorites, and log out. Admins will be able to utilize CRUD on the front end for creating, updating, and deleting dishes. This app will be stiled with Material UI.
